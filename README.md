# MLops Pipelines For Real-time Credit Fraud Detection
---
## 1/ Project Overview:
Just imagine you are a normal customer at PNC Bank.
Your credit card life is very predictable: you just use it to order food online, usually under $70, and you’re loyal to your hometown (you basically never leave it). If your credit card had a personality, it would be "boring but reliable".

Then one night, at 2:45 AM, while you’re peacefully asleep, your credit card decides it’s time for an adventure.

💥 $6,350 spent at an online electronics store.

💥 Another big purchase a few minutes later.

💥 Both occurring nearly 1000 miles apart.

The fraud detection system at PNC then raises an eyebrow.

“This doesn’t look like our late-night pizza order…”

Within seconds, the system flags the transactions, blocks the card, and sends you a message asking if you’ve somehow turned into a midnight tech enthusiast. You reply NO, your card is saved, and your credit card goes back to its quiet, food-ordering life.
