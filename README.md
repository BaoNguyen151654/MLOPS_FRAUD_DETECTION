# MLops Pipelines For Real-time Credit Fraud Detection
---
## 1/ Project Overview:
Just imagine you are a perfectly normal customer at PNC Bank.
Your credit card life is very predictable: you use it to order food online, usually under $70, and you’re loyal to your hometown (you basically never leave it). If your credit card had a personality, it would be "boring but reliable".

Then one night, at 2:45 AM, while you’re peacefully asleep, your credit card suddenly decides it’s time for an adventure.

💥 $1,350 spent at an online electronics store.

💥 Another big purchase a few minutes later.

💥 Both occurring nearly 500 miles apart.
